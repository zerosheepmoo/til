# I need a new memo tool

I used to memo with memo tools, because I have a memory like a cache.

The problem is I use a messy desktop memo, so I cannot find what I need.

Notion and Evernote is overkill for me.

I thought a pretty memo updated steadily
whenever I learn new things would be perfect. (like a blog)

Then I came up with TIL.

Basically, I would not post in English, cuz my native lang is Korean.

Please check in Korean.

Sometimes, I would do post if it is necessary to do it in English.
